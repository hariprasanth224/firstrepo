       <p>College Management System deals with all kind of student details, academic related reports, college details, course details, curriculum, batch details and other resource related details too. It tracks all the details of a student from the day one to the end of his course which can be used for all reporting purpose, tracking of attendance, progress in the course, completed semesters years, coming semester year curriculum details, exam details, project or any other assignment details, final exam result; and all these will be available for future references too.Our program will have the databases of Courses offered by the college under all levels of graduation or main streams, teacher or faculty's details, batch execution details, students' details in all aspects.This program can facilitate us explore all the activities happening in the college, even we can get to know which teacher / faculty is assigned to which batch, the current status of a batch, attendance percentage of a batch and upcoming requirements of a batch. Different reports and Queries can be generated based of vast options related to students, batch, course, teacher / faculty, exams, semesters, certification and even for the entire college.

        The College management system is an automated version of manual Student Management System. It can handle all details about a student. The details include college details, subject details, student personnel details, academic details, exam details etc... In case of manual system they need a lot of time, manpower etc.Here almost all work is computerized. So the accuracy is maintained. Maintaining backup is very easy. It can do with in a few minutes. Our system has two type of accessing modes, administrator and user. Student management system is managed by an administrator. It is the job of the administrator to insert update and monitor the whole process. When a user log in to the system. He would only view details of the student. He can't perform any changes .      
        College Management System
        College management system is an integrated web application that handles various academic and non academic activities of a College/Academic Institute. The system can access by every students/faculties/employees of the institution through internet connected computers or internet enabled mobile devices with the aid of his user name and password. Every user will have a customized home page with his/her profile management facilities. Through links that displays in the home page the user can access different options of the website assigned to him.Though the system allows access to every one there is a significant security risk involved in this project. To tackle this problem we suggest a modular structure in the proposed system and a complete isolation of the financial and administrative modules from the public portal. Only trusted IPs can access these modules. Web services will interact to the financial and administrative modules to fetch necessary information to display in the public portal. Although a standard password policy will be followed in the designing of the system to prevent the possibilities of malicious activities of itching users.A self driven module in the proposed system will accomplish the automated tasks such as Email Alerts, SMS alerts, Notifications to the administrator etc.
        
        Some of the features of the proposed system are
        
        1. Student Admission
        2. Student Fee management
        3. Student Attendance Management
        4. Staff Attendance Management
        5. Staff Payroll Management
        6. Library Management
        7. User Management</p>
